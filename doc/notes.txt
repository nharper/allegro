Member management
- If Member is the most generic model for a person, it needs to support
  singing, non-singing, staff, volunteer, alumni, etc.
- member model same as user or is user different?
  - (user is model for how one logs in)

Files and Music storage
- could provide rich model for music
  - a piece could belong to multiple concerts
  - it could have multiple versions
  - songs sould be put in order for the concert
- this doesn't work so well for other files
  - some files don't belong to concerts, e.g. board files
    - some of these could belong to a particular season though
      - e.g. election info, season subscriptions, non-concert events
  - some files belong to concerts, but aren't part of the running order
    - e.g. ticket order forms
  - some files belong to a concert and a song, but aren't music
    - rehearsal tracks
    - choreography videos

User friendliness
- would need to ask users what they need
- "everything about ..."
- action items
